# ToolbarSample

Sample of a reusable toolbar or toolbox component that will manage and render a set of 'tools' by way of a dropdown menu.  the menu tracks the state of which tools are currently open, and clicking the tool again hides it.  

Future plans are:

 --add in user state management, to render the component with any tools that were previously selected already displayed.
 --add user cusomizable positioning in the workspace (vertical display of tools, left or right side of screen)
 --build out tool components to hide icons as the viewport shrinks, adding them to a expanding menu or scrolling view. 
 --display tools in order that they were selected(currently set to display in hard coded order)
